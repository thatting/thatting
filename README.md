- 👋 Hi, I’m @thatting.
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud computing, machine learning and data analytics. 
- 🌱  I have a good skills and knowledge of cloud computing, in particular AWS. I have passed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. I am currently preparing for the AWS Specialty in Machine Learning. My favourite language is Python, but I can also work in JavaScript and C/C+. I have experience with Keras/TensorFlow applied to computer vision, timeseries and natural language processing. I also have experience with data processing frameworks such as Apache Spark. Furthermore, I am familiar with the practice of DevOps, including the use of CI/CD and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Currently, I am working on a number of machine learning and data analysis projects.  As a side note, I am currently reading "The Unicorn Project" (sequel to the "The Phoenix Project").
- 💞️ I'm interested in roles where I can apply my knowledge and skills, for example, Cloud Developer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Engineer, ML DevOps Engineer, Python Developer.
