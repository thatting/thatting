- 👋 Hi, I’m @thatting
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning and DevOps 
- 🌱 I hold the AWS Solutions Architect certification. I am currently preparing for the AWS Specialty certifications in Machine Learning. As always, I am honing my skills in programming. My favourite language is Python but I can also work in JavaScript and C/C+. Currently, I am working on a number of machine learning projects. I am also learning about DevOps and am currently reading "The Phoenix Project".
