- 👋 Hi, I’m @thatting.
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, cloud computing, machine learning and data analytics. 
- 🌱 I have a good skills and knowledge of cloud computing, in particular AWS. I have passed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. I am currently preparing for the AWS Specialty in Machine Learning. My favourite language is Python but I can also work in JavaScript and C/C+. At the moment, I am working on a number of machine learning and data analytics projects. I have experience with Keras/Tensorflow applied to computer vision and natural language processing. I am also learning about new areas in machine learning such as generative AI. I have also experience with data processing frameworks such as Apache Spark. I have knowledge and understanding of DevOps, and I am currently reading "The Unicorn Project" (sequel to the "The Phoenix Project").
- 💞️ I'm interested in roles where I can apply my knowledge and competences, for example, Cloud Developer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Engineer, ML DevOps Engineer, Python Developer.
