- 👋 Hi, I’m @thatting.
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud computing, machine learning and data analytics. 
- 🌱  I have knowledge and experience of cloud computing in areas such as compute, storage, networking and security. I have passed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. My favourite programming language is Python, but I can also work in JavaScript and C/C+. I have understanding and experience of the machine learning lifecycle i.e. data wrangling, model training and deployment, in particular using SageMaker. Furthermore, I am familiar with machine learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, applied to computer vision, natural language processing and generative AI. Moreover, I am familiar with MLOps which are the principles and tools for bringing machine learning models into a production environment. Lastly, I have experience with data warehouse and data lake systems such as Cassandra, Redshift and Spark. As a side note, at the moment, I am reading "Generative Deep Learning" by David Foster. 
- 💞️ I'm interested in roles where I can apply my knowledge and skills, for example, Cloud DevOps Engineer, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, MLOps Engineer, Python Developer.
