- 👋 Hi, I’m @thatting
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning and DevOps 
- 🌱 I have passed the AWS Solutions Architect exam and am currently preparing for the Developer Associate and SysOps Administrator exams. Also, as always, I am honing my skills in programming. My favourite language is Python but I can also work in JavaScript and C/C+. Currently, I am working on a number of machine learning projects on computer vision and natural language processing.  I am also learning about DevOps and am currently reading "The Phoenix Project".
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects as a Cloud Developer / Architect.
