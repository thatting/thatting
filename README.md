- 👋 Hi, I’m @thatting.
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud computing, machine learning and data engineering. 
- 🌱 I have knowledge and experience of cloud computing in areas such as compute, storage, networking and security, in particular AWS. My favourite programming language is Python, but I can also work in JavaScript and C/C+. I have understanding and experience of the machine learning lifecycle i.e. data wrangling, model training and deployment, in particular using SageMaker. Furthermore, I am familiar with machine learning libraries, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow and Hugging Face, applied to computer vision and natural language processing, including the use of generative and agentic AI. Moreover, I am familiar with MLOps for bringing machine learning models reliably and efficiently into a production environment. Lastly, I have experience with data warehouse, data lake and workflow systems such as Redshift, Glue and Apache Airflow. I hold an AWS certification as Solutions Architect. As a side note, currently, I am reading "AI Product Manager's Handbook" by Irene Bratsis. 
- 💞️ I'm interested in roles where I can apply my knowledge and skills, for example, machine learning engineer, data engineer, generative AI engineer, agentic AI engineer, AI product manager.
