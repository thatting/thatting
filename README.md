- 👀 I’m interested in software development, cloud computing, machine learning and data analytics. 
- 🌱 I have a good skills and knowledge of cloud computing, in particular AWS. I have passed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. I am currently preparing for the AWS Specialty in Machine Learning. My favourite language is Python, but I can also work in JavaScript and C/C+. At the moment, I am working on a number of machine learning and data analytics projects. I have experience with Keras and Tensorflow applied to computer vision and natural language processing. I also have experience with data processing frameworks such as Apache Spark. Furthermore, I have experience and understanding of DevOps, including Infrastructure as Code (IaC), in an AWS environment. I am currently reading "The Unicorn Project" (sequel to the "The Phoenix Project").
