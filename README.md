- 👋 Hi, I’m @thatting.
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud computing, machine learning and data analytics. 
- 🌱  I have knowledge and experience of cloud computing in areas such as compute, storage, networking and security. I have passed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. I am currently preparing for the AWS Specialty in Machine Learning. My favourite programming language is Python, but I can also work in JavaScript and C/C+. I have understanding and experience of the machine learning lifecycle i.e. data preparation, model training and deployment, in particular through the use of SageMaker. I am familiar with machine learning libraries applied to Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I also have experience with data processing frameworks such as Apache Spark. Furthermore, I am familiar with DevOps, including Infrastructure as Code and implementation of CI/CD pipelines. Currently, I am working on a number of machine learning and data analysis projects.  As a side note, I am at the moment reading "The Unicorn Project" (sequel to the "The Phoenix Project").
- 💞️ I'm interested in roles where I can apply my knowledge and skills, for example, Cloud Developer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Engineer, ML DevOps Engineer, Python Developer.
