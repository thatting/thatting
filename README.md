- 👋 Hi, I’m @thatting.
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud computing, machine learning and data engineering. 
- 🌱   I have knowledge and experience of cloud computing in areas such as compute, storage, networking and security. I have passed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. My favourite programming language is Python, but I can also work in JavaScript and C/C+. I have understanding and experience of the machine learning lifecycle i.e. data wrangling, model training and deployment, in particular using AWS SageMaker. Furthermore, I am familiar with machine learning libraries, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow and Hugging Face, applied to computer vision, natural language processing and generative AI (foundation models). Moreover, I am familiar with MLOps, which are principles and tools for bringing machine learning models into a production environment reliably and efficiently. Lastly, I have experience with data warehouse, data lake and workflow systems such as Redshift, Glue and Apache Airflow. As a side note, at the moment, I am reading "Generative AI on AWS" by C. Fregly et al. 
- 💞️ I'm interested in roles where I can apply my knowledge and skills, for example, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Generative AI Engineer, Cloud DevOps Engineer.
